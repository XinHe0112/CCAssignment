 * 1.A door n is toggled once for each factor of n, including itself and 1. 
 * 2. A door is left open if the number of factors is odd.
 * 3.The value x is odd if n is aperfecr squre, because we can pair n's factor by their complement.
 * 4.There are 10 perfect squares. You can count them (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100), or you
 * can simply realize that you can take the  numbers 1 through 10 adn squre them:
 * 1*1, 2*2, 3*3..... 10*10
 * 
 *Therefore, there are 10 lockers open at the end of this process.
