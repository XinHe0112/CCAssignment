 * Case 1: Only one person has blue eyes:
 * Since he should find all others don't have bule eyes, he must realize
 * it is he who has blue eyes. Thus he would take the flight that everning.
 * 
 * Case 2: Exactly two persons have blue eyes:
 * They can see each other's eyes, but they don't know their own color.
 * If there are only one person with blue eyes, he must leave on the 
 * first night; but if there are still blue-eyed person, he must deduce
 * that himself has blue eyes.
 * Both blue-eyed guys will leave on the second night
 * 
 * Case 3: More than two persons have blue eyes:
 * Suppose the number of blue-eyed person is n, those people will 
 * immediately know that there are either n or n-1 people with blue eyes.
 * If there are n-1 blue eyed people, then they will leave on (n-1)th night
 * So when others are still around that night, each person would realize
 * that there are n blue-eyed people, thet would leave that night.
